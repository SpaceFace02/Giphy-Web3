# Giphy Web3.0 Project

## Check out deployed website - [https://giphy-web3.netlify.app/](https://giphy-web3.netlify.app/)

## Imp - When you check out the website, reload the page once, sometimes there's a bug that you can't see the gifs below in the latest transactions section.

### Steps to ensure perfect Working:

1. Check out the deployed website in Google Chrome preferably, with the metamash extension installed.
2. Install and set up MetaMask chrome extension, if you haven't already.
3. Make sure you create an **Ropsten** test account, and add some etherum to it, using some [faucet](https://faucet.egorfine.com/).
4. Click on Connect Wallet and connect the wallet with the ethereum.
5. Create another account to receive the etherum. (Make sure its Ropsten).
6. Enter the receiver's wallet address and keywords and messages.
7. Click on Send Now and wait for 30-45 seconds for it to be reflected in the block chain.
8. Check out the console as well, for additional messages. (If you are a developer).
9. After you see **success** or when the loading animation disappears, reload the page once if you can't see the new GIF added in the latest transaction section.
